# CopyFilePath0001
A utility to get size of the file path on right click or as a second argument.

This utility is made in the style of https://github.com/CodeDmitry/FileSize0001 with the same design decisions, plus one more; In this utility, I use an optional input argument to allow entering mocking the file path, thus allowing us to test the program without tinkering with arguments to the program.

This utility is installed using the same method as https://github.com/CodeDmitry/FileSize0001 except it is reccomended to install using "Copy File Path" registry key rather than "Copy File Size" registry key.
